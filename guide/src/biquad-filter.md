# Bi-Quad Filter

## What is the Bi-Quad Filter

MDN says:

> The [BiquadFilterNode](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/BiquadFilterNode) interface represents a simple low-order filter, and is created using the BaseAudioContext/createBiquadFilter method. It is an `AudioNode` that can represent different kinds of filters, tone control devices, and graphic equalizers.

This app used the `WaveShaperNode` to help synthesize the snare drum, but the Biquad Filter could have been used as well.
